        <p style="font-size:110%;text-align:left;font-family:rockwell; color:#1a0d00;">Cillian Damien Murphy is an Irish actor. He was born May 25, 1976 in Douglas, Cork (Ireland). He was
         raised in Ballintemple, Cork alongside his three younger siblings. At the age of only ten, he began writing and performing songs. He attended Presentation
         Brothers College and often found himself in trouble, until his fourth year, as he found they neglected artistic pursuits for creative-minded children like     
         him. There, he found his love for drama while performing his first module introduced by the Corcadorca Theatre Company directed by Pat Kiernan. His English 
         teacher pushed him to pursue acting but he set out to become a rock star. In his late teens and early twenties, he was in several bands with his brother, 
         Páidi, even being offered a record deal declined due to his brother's involvement in school. Murphy began studying law at University College Cork in 1996 
         but failed his first-year exams on account of his "lack of ambition". Upon seeing Kiernan's stage production of "A Clockwork Orange" he began focusing his 
         attention on pursuing acting. He began pressuring Kiernan for a role in one of his upcoming productions and landed his debut as a volatile Cork teenager in 
         Edna Walsh's "Disco Pigs". The production, originally meant to last three weeks, ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, 
         rocket-launching his career. He left his university, and band and began starring in several other theatre productions till being cast as the lead role in 
         Danny Boyle's horror film "28 Days Later", in 2002, with the film becoming a massive hit worldwide. He earned nominations for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire 
         Awards and Breakthrough Male Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards. From that point on, he received several awards and landed many serious roles in popular 
         films and series like Batman Begins, Red Eye, Breakfast on Pluto, The Wind that Shakes the Barley, Peaky Blinders, Dunkirk and Oppenheimer.</p>
